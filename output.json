Remaster is anything that uses the original as a base and improves it vs redoing the whole thing but making it feel/look like the original. Like digitally de-noising an old track to make it sound better vs getting the original band back together to re-record it with better equipment.\n\nThe same logic can be used for games. If they are taking the actual fully made game and going in and improving textures, adding quality of life features etc. then thats a remaster. If they redo the game, like remaking it in a different engine or just starting from scratch then even if they are taking some of the original parts and putting them in that would still be a remake.",

If a good game being remade ends up adding extra pieces to the story that make it an incredible story, I feel as though that should be rewarded\n\nThe line is super thin, which is why I feel like this is such a hard topic to really debate about because I think most people have the same opinion. I think everyone agrees that if all you do is essentially turn the resolution slider up and AI upscale your old assets, you should never be given awards for that kind of content. I think where the conversation gets weirder to me is in places like the RE remakes, FF7 Remake + Rebirth, and even in some ways Dead Space because you are from the core starting from nothing. Your not reusing any OG code or assets, you are starting from scratch with a framework but you are able to build on that as much or as little as you would like and that ends up creating a fundamentally different experience because you have a whole different team building this new game",

Pretty much everyone agrees that the Asteroid Defense System cannons section was the worst part of the original game. It's a frustrating section where you have to blow up asteroids with a painfully slow fixed turret that's easy to fail and plays nothing like the rest of the game. So the remake removed that section, mechanically, and redid the ADS cannons with completely new mechanics. They also swapped how zero-g locomotion worked to the much preferred implementation in Dead Space 2 and 3 (remaking the levels that used the mechanic so they made sense with the change).\n\nThe coolest part was that the remake embraced the power difference between 7th and 9th gen consoles. The lighting system is much more robust, so the spaceship full of monsters is much darker and more reliant on your flashlight (they even added a section where you need to power an elevator by diverting power from either the lights or life support, making you rely on either your suit's tiny flashlight or tiny air canister), and what used to be a series of discreet levels is now seamless and with more backtracking to take advantage of it.",

Almost the same game but with the other protagonist we never got in the west, better combat and movement to better match with Nier: Automata, reorchestrated music, full voice acting in every scene and with every character, new story sections, and a whole new ending adapted from side material which furthers the game's story/lore substantially. The release still uses the PS3 original as a base but really overhauls and adds quite a bit. It's in a weird area, kind of between a remaster and a remake but I think it totally deserved to be a part of the Game Awards with all of the effort put into bringing it into the modern age.",

They are in Remake as beings who's purpose is to make sure events go according to fate. At the end, against the semi-final boss the Whisper Harbinger, is a brief flash forward to an Advent Children scene (and a glimpse of Aerith's death scene), with Red XIII stating it was \"a glimpse of tomorrow if we fail here today\". The party does not fail, defeating the Whispers and defying fate, implying possible timeline changes in the next games.\n\nConsidering the Advent Children references in the \"original\" FF7, safe to say the game is a pseudo-sequel in some regard. Along with Sephiroth, there seems to be hints that Aerith may know a bit more than she leads on as well. Can't wait to see how it plays out.",

That same outlet put PUBG on the 2017 GOTY ballot when at the time it was as technically sound as a vanilla Bethesda RPG, and it got in over games like Resident Evil 7, Nier Automata and Hellblade. It's almost funny.\n\nOh and the year where Last of Us 2 got like every other award. I'll tinfoil the hell out of Sony deciding \"Alright TLOU2 fandom is in civil war mode, shell out big bucks to awards show for that good PR to help\" over that one.",

Sure, the game is the same but all the assests are remade and things like the controls upgraded for the new system. I guess I still wouldn't count them for awards unless it's really been overhauled and it's not just a Same Game HD.\n\nRe-imagining (e.g. FF7 Remake, RE2 Remake). Totally fair. Despite the name, these barely qualify as remakes. It's basically a different game. Just because the premise is the same doesn't mean anything, people put a lot of work into making it new.

A publisher can put out a game with any title they want and refer to it however they want to as a marketing choice. Naughty Dog relating to their work in TLOU Part 1 as a remake doesn't ultimately matter.\n\nThe bar for a bona-fide remake would typically be more aligned to a re-imagining, more substantive and less strictly focused on visual fidelity upgrades, which rules out TLOU Part 1.\n\nTLOU Part 1 is very similar in scope to eg. Metroid Prime Remastered, where there's a pretty significant asset overhaul but zero or almost zero gameplay changes.\n\nCompare that to say, RE2 Remake where the characters and setting are the only thing tying it to the original. It's a total re-imagining of a concept, and that's more prototypical of what a remake is.",
